The massive decision comes after a long wait of 28 years. The opposition claims that the Hindus have appeased whereas the accused declare that the truth has finally triumphed.\n\nThe court states there was not enough evidence found to hold against the accused. It has also deduced that the 32 charged were trying to stop the demolition instead of instigating it. BJP Leader, MM Joshi comments that they have accepted the verdict and urges everyone to let go of the conflict and concentrate on making way for Ram temple construction.\n\nSubramanian Swamy, Rajya Sabha MP states that the courts have been independent and in fact, if there was no democracy and a majoritarian government in place from day one then this would have ended long back. Shahid Siddiqui, Editor of Nayi Duniya, also says that had it not been for Supreme Court intervention in 2017, the case would have been over long back.

The massive decision comes after a long wait of 28 years. The opposition claims that the Hindus have appeased whereas the accused declare that the truth has finally triumphed.\n\nThe court states there was not enough evidence found to hold against the accused. It has also deduced that the 32 charged were trying to stop the demolition instead of instigating it. BJP Leader, MM Joshi comments that they have accepted the verdict and urges everyone to let go of the conflict and concentrate on making way for Ram temple construction.\n\nSubramanian Swamy, Rajya Sabha MP states that the courts have been independent and in fact, if there was no democracy and a majoritarian government in place from day one then this would have ended long back. Shahid Siddiqui, Editor of Nayi Duniya, also says that had it not been for Supreme Court intervention in 2017, the case would have been over long back.
