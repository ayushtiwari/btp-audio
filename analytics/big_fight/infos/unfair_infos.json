A week that has seen parliament pass the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2019 that was signed into law by the President at midnight. The bill has opened two separate fronts in India. In the Northeast, there are concerns that 'outsiders' will take over their tradition, culture and livelihood. These concerns have sparked violent protests, particularly in Assam. On a bigger scale, across the country, not only Opposition parties but also many concerned citizens and even international community have flagged the concern about whether this bill actually runs contrary to the spirit of India's constitution.

The China model of mass manufacturing and export cannot be replicated anymore in today's world. Are start-ups the way out? Perhaps. But, only if you are a skilled worker. For all the semi-skilled or unskilled workers, the situation is really problematic. Will they depend on government doles for day-to-day existence? The Modi government had placed a lot of emphasis on skill development but the lack of a strong education base and low industry demand is affecting their prospect. The industry, while admitting the changing scenario, is looking for niche skills - nano technologists, experts on robotics, high-end researchers, experienced managers in assembly line production but our education sector has been unable to keep pace with the changing demand. According to an Ernst & Young and FICCI study, over 80 percent of India's engineering graduates and around 90 percent of MBAs are unemployable.

The big guns are out. PM Narendra Modi will have 12 rallies. Tejashwi Yadav is having 12 rallies every day. Meanwhile there is a side script in the NDA with Chirag Paswan. He claims to be with BJP, though BJP claims to be with Nitish Kumar. Rahul Gandhi has also hit the campaign trail, criticising PM Modi. But this time around, one notices a peculiar trend. Gone are the days when Nitish Kumar led the NDA in Bihar. Is this a case where he has had to pillion ride on PM Modi's popularity, that too after 15 years of leading a government? In his speeches, he mentions more about the central government schemes than his own.

But all this inconvenience would be washed away only if the the 'big fishes' or 'fat cats' - those with black money - be caught and appropriate punishment meted out. Otherwise it will be the long queues, the hardships and the loss of business and jobs that will remain an indelible memory.
