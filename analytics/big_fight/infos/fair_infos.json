The other sore point that got mentioned in the Prime Minister's speech was the centre's placatory gesture towards Jammu and Kashmir and the subsequent efforts by both state and central government to stop the violence in the valley. So is this PM Modi's new game-plan of being tough on Pakistan and soft on Kashmir?

The GDP is at 5 per cent, the lowest in over six years; auto sales are their lowest in over 20 years; rural wage growth has collapsed to 1 per cent in 2018-19 compared to 15 per cent in 2013-14; while unemployment is at a 45-year-high. But over the last week, much of the news has focused on the dreaded two Ms - Math and Millennials. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the fact that millennials are using car apps like OLA and Uber is the reason car sales are down. She's got a lot of flak for it, simply because the data doesn't match her claims, and then why are truck sales also down? Then Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday how numbers don't matter, \"after all Math didn't help Einstein discover gravity\", but it did make Mr Goyal trend on Twitter all day. But that's not the point. People make mistakes. Yes, Issac Newton discovered gravity, not Albert Einstein. But the bigger point is: Is the government taking the economic slowdown as seriously as it should be? Is it time to put partisan politics aside, sit down with someone like Dr Manmohan Singh and try and find solutions?\n\nQuick access links: \n\nEconomic crisis: Govt steps not enough?\nhttps://bit.ly/2lQlQe4\n\nAuto crisis: Is 'millennial mindset' a factor?\nhttps://bit.ly/2lQTr7A\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

The GDP is at 5 per cent, the lowest in over six years; auto sales are their lowest in over 20 years; rural wage growth has collapsed to 1 per cent in 2018-19 compared to 15 per cent in 2013-14; while unemployment is at a 45-year-high. But over the last week, much of the news has focused on the dreaded two Ms - Math and Millennials. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the fact that millennials are using car apps like OLA and Uber is the reason car sales are down. She's got a lot of flak for it, simply because the data doesn't match her claims, and then why are truck sales also down? Then Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday how numbers don't matter, \"after all Math didn't help Einstein discover gravity\", but it did make Mr Goyal trend on Twitter all day. But that's not the point. People make mistakes. Yes, Issac Newton discovered gravity, not Albert Einstein. But the bigger point is: Is the government taking the economic slowdown as seriously as it should be?

Seven weeks after the election results, the country's grand old party is facing an existential crisis. Then there are the regional parties who enjoyed a dominant role in the coalition era before 2014 and seemed to be giving the BJP the only real fight state-by-state. But look at their situation today. After winning just five seats in UP, Akhilesh Yadav, the head of the party, disappeared and went abroad, only to return to India earlier this week. Lalu Yadav's RJD, under his son Tejwaswi, got zero seats in Bihar - a first for the party which has been a powerful regional force. Tejwasi has been AWOL most of the last few weeks as well. Maywati didn't do that much better in UP, with 10 seats. Chandrababu Naidu's TDP is also unravelling quickly - four of his six Rajya Sabha MPs joined the BJP. The only parties that withstood the Modi wave were the DMK, the BJD, the TRS, and to some extent Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress, but here too, the TMC is facing a strong challenge ahead of the Bengal state polls.

Now Money Bills, according to the constitution, need not be passed or amended by the Rajya Sabha, where the BJP is in minority. So were the reforms in contravention to the basic spirit of the Constitution? Did the BJP brought in 'allied reforms' in the Finance Bill and not as a separate Bill to evade the Rajya Sabha? Are the poll reforms, vesting more powers on Income Tax officers, making Aadhaar mandatory for filing I-T returns and making sweeping changes to Appellate Tribunals a subversion of constitution? The government, in its defence, is falling back to previous UPA and NDA regimes where poll reforms were tagged along the Finance Bill. The other controversial justification, which the spin doctors of the government are providing is that the Upper House of the Parliament cannot block 'people's wishes' as was evident through BJP's victories in a number of elections post 2014.\n\nWatch full video: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/the-big-fight/big-fight-over-finance-bill-amendments-453429?yt\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

Now Money Bills, according to the constitution, need not be passed or amended by the Rajya Sabha, where the BJP is in minority. So were the reforms in contravention to the basic spirit of the Constitution? Did the BJP brought in 'allied reforms' in the Finance Bill and not as a separate Bill to evade the Rajya Sabha? Are the poll reforms, vesting more powers on Income Tax officers, making Aadhaar mandatory for filing I-T returns and making sweeping changes to Appellate Tribunals a subversion of constitution?
