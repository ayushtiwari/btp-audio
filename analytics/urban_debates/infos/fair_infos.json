The Centre for Disease Control and NITI Aayog has issued a warning to groups that are vulnerable who can be severely affected in the coming winters.\nThe pollution and smog in the northern parts of the country, especially Delhi may get massively affected according to Dr. Mahesh Chandra Misra, Former Director of AIIMS. To combat this he said, \u201cPeople can use one thin cloth mask, and a mask on top of it. This will prevent them from pollution and Covid-19.\u201d \nWhen asked whether the pollution or the cold temperatures will affect our respiratory problems more, Dr. Shashank Joshi, DEAN Indian College of Physicians, Lilavati Hospital and Member, Covid-19 Task Force, replied that its the people\u2019s irresponsibility. He said, \u201cThe biggest challenge that we have is that as we are unlocking people are behaving irresponsibly.\u201d He added that even though there has not been a relationship between cold and Covid-19, the same may not be true for India, since we are a tropical country.\n#Covid-19 #CovidInIndia\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW for more such videos \u25bahttp://bit.ly/2LesD8T\n\nFor More Updates \u25ba http://www.mirrornownews.com\nLike us on Facebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Twitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Instagram \u25ba https://instagram.com/MirrorNow"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT42M58S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "184", "likeCount": "6", "dislikeCount": "2", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}}], "Tp5-RC7mFN0": [{"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "fY1LQ8lyRMpShMcajWTYK0wwyB0", "id": "Tp5-RC7mFN0", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-10-22T18:13:46Z", "channelId": "UCWCEYVwSqr7Epo6sSCfUgiw", "title": "Is India's COVID-19 race on right track? | The Urban Debate", "description": "On The Urban Debate today, Tanvi Shukla illustrates nine such stages that are needed to be crossed before COVID-19 vaccine reaches anyone of us.

Lok Sabha has now passed the contentious Essential Commodities, Bill. Why are farmers protesting the ordinances? Are the ordinances anti-farmer?\n\nThe farmers have protested in Punjab, Haryana and North-Eastern States. According to them, their requests have not been considered. This bill will impact their Minimum Support Price (MSP) privilege. Rakesh Tikait of Bharatiya Kisan Union says the private mandis will shut down after 2 years on which tax has to be paid. The farmers stocking capacity is also an issue which is not addressed in the bill. This is objectionable.  \n\nAs per the 7th schedule of the Constitution, the agriculture & Mandis are state subject.  The promulgation of an ordinance of GOI without taking into consideration the State is questionable says Professor Gourav Vallabh of Congress.\n\n#FarmersProtest #EssentialCommoditiesBill\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW for more such videos \u25bahttp://bit.ly/2LesD8T\n\nFor More Updates \u25ba http://www.mirrornownews.com\nLike us on Facebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Twitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Instagram \u25ba https://instagram.com/MirrorNow"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT41M39S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "548", "likeCount": "16", "dislikeCount": "1", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "3"}}], "3US0oP3ggfg": [{"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "sPmq2vh8oB-E1mhP0xhg5Nfsssc", "id": "3US0oP3ggfg", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-12-03T17:38:01Z", "channelId": "UCWCEYVwSqr7Epo6sSCfUgiw", "title": "Rajinikanth makes political entry; Will Thalaivar convert his fans into voters? | The Urban Debate", "description": "On the Urban Debate today, Tanvi Shukla talks about the latest and probably the biggest political blockbuster news, that is Rajinikanth making an announcement of entering politics.
