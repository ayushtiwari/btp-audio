U.P CM in a rally said that the state is going to introduce stricter laws to fight Love Jihad. Following U.P CM, other BJP ruled states have announced a similar action to that of Yogi Adityanath. Love Jihad is once again back into the narrative. 5 BJP ruled states have stated that they are mulling an anti-conversion law. Yogi Adityanath was backed by Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Assam. The leaders of all these states have used the term Love Jihad repeatedly. Tanvi Shukla explains how it all started and whether the existing laws are not enough?\n\nTo discuss the same, Tanvi Shukla takes with the panelists on the show. Fuad Halim CPI(M) leader states that the issue in itself is pathetic.
