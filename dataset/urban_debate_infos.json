Further, the NGT has advised banning crackers and the use of green crackers is no remedy for this problem. Rajasthan has taken the lead and has banned the sale of crackers, however, all other states should also follow, especially those in North India, as they are already battling with pollution.\n\nThe same is taken up with the panelists Raman Malik and Manpreet Sandhu, and Dr. Sanjeev Bagai. Sanjeev Bagai states that this year's Diwali celebration will no less than be a death trap for all of us.

Both have to go hand in hand,' says Sidharth Luthra, Former Additional Solicitor General.\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW for more such videos \u25bahttp://bit.ly/2LesD8T\n\nFor More Updates \u25ba http://www.mirrornownews.com\nLike us on Facebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Twitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Instagram \u25ba https://instagram.com/MirrorNow"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT44M35S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "2626", "likeCount": "5", "dislikeCount": "0", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}}, "ssuosxkqPvg": {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "mKIoaCycDKQRfQ8VY_eYVpxu7WQ", "id": "ssuosxkqPvg", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-10-06T19:54:25Z", "channelId": "UCWCEYVwSqr7Epo6sSCfUgiw", "title": "Bihar elections: JDU-NDA alliance gets strong; LGP nudged out | The Urban Debate", "description": "On the Urban Debate today, Tanvi Shukla discusses the Bihar elections, which are just around the corner.

Satish Maneshinde, Rhea Chakraborty\u2019s lawyer has stated that the Mumbai Police had also reached a conclusion after the Cooper Hospital\u2019s toxicology report that there was no foul play involved. He went ahead to say, \u201cI would beseech all those who are jumping to conclusions, to come to rest & wait for the CBI to make a declaration and file a report before the Court of law\u201d. \n\nSanjay Hegde, a senior Supreme Court Advocate, commented on the entire case by stating, \u201cSushant Singh Rajput had had a history of mental illness, there were fights over his treatment, things had not gone well at that stage in his career. He committed suicide. It has been blown up.

Adar Poonawalla, the Chief Executive Officer of the Serum Institute of India, which is conducting trials of the COVID-19 vaccine. Adar Poonawalla on Saturday raised questions regarding the country\u2019s plan to produce and distribute shots against the coronavirus disease.\n\nAdar Poonawalla stated that the government needs a budget of 80,000 crores and a plan to deliver the process of vaccinating a billion people.\n\nPhase 3 trials of the vaccine have been developed by Oxford University and British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, the vaccine is underway in India as part of a production and testing deal with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII). Adar Poonawalla tweeted over how the government of India has to manage a fund of 80,000 crores available, over the next one year.

Cyber Security Expert Ritesh Bhatia explains what is the Chinese firm Zhenhua doing and if there should be any concern. \n\nHe says that the Zhenhua collects massive documents and information about key personalities. Zhenhua also tracks digital footprints of these personalities, he further adds. Information library is created from various sources. It also has data on people and their relations with various institutions. Data collected by this firm can also be used to access the dark web and run multiple algorithms. \n\nEvery govt does these kinds of practices, the issue is, we're ignoring it at a massive scale. Concern should be how they're able to acquire data. If they're acquiring it by buying it from Indian companies, that is important.\n\n#ZhenhuaData\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW for more such videos \u25bahttp://bit.ly/2LesD8T\n\nFor More Updates \u25ba http://www.mirrornownews.com\nLike us on Facebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Twitter \u25ba https://twitter.com/MirrorNow\nFollow us on Instagram \u25ba https://instagram.com/MirrorNow"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "contentDetails": {"duration": "PT44M48S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "sd", "caption": "false", "licensedContent": true, "contentRating": {}, "projection": "rectangular"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "147", "likeCount": "4", "dislikeCount": "1", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "0"}}, "CWIk7CfgN0Y": {"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "iVgaHSto42yGnzAwFYWNeEDHWDY", "id": "CWIk7CfgN0Y", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-09-14T17:42:40Z", "channelId": "UCWCEYVwSqr7Epo6sSCfUgiw", "title": "Is Umar Khalid's arrest by Delhi Police 'political'? | The Urban Debate", "description": "On the Urban Debate with Tanvi Shukla, we discuss former JNU student leader Umar Khalid's arrest in the Delhi riots case.
