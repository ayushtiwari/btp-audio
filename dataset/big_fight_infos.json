Our leaders often make big proclamations that India's caste divide is narrowing, that caste is slowly beginning to matter less in the way people vote, but is that true? When Mr Modi won his massive mandate in May, he said in his victory speech that \"Only two castes will remain in this country: the poor and those who contribute whatever little to free the country from poverty.\" But is that narrative reflective of the reality on the ground? On the other hand, politically, the emergence of leaders like Chandrasheker Azad, who have challenged the BJP's brand of politics has also created a stir, but has it really made an impact? In this new India, is caste discrimination more entrenched than ever before?\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

The story of Sakshi Misra and her husband Ajitesh is right out of a bad Bollywood film - her father is a BJP lawmaker from UP, her husband Ajitesh was beaten up in the Allahabad High Court the other day - but it's a story that also represents the very cruel reality of caste in India. Our leaders often make big proclamations that India's caste divide is narrowing, that caste is slowly beginning to matter less in the way people vote, but is that true? When Mr Modi won his massive mandate in May, he said in his victory speech that \"Only two castes will remain in this country: the poor and those who contribute whatever little to free the country from poverty.\" But is that narrative reflective of the reality on the ground? On the other hand, politically, the emergence of leaders like Chandrasheker Azad, who have challenged the BJP's brand of politics has also created a stir, but has it really made an impact? In this new India, is caste discrimination more entrenched than ever before?\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

The order led to enormous backlash by the journalistic community that saw the move as a way to muzzle the press. The Modi government was quick to react, as the circular was revoked on the orders of the Prime Minister. However later in the week, there was another controversial announcement over the formation of a committee to regulate online news, with not a single member from the platform to represent them. Could this be seen as an attempt by the government to keep a tab on online content? Is it better for the media to be its own watchdog?

Narendra Modi had promised us that he will transform India, end corruption, bring in industry, generate jobs, end social strife and forge a new path with neighbours and word powers. With his emphatic victory in the polls people were buoyed with the hope of a transformation that would herald a new era and catapult India towards a path of development. \n\nThree years have passed since Narendra Modi was anointed as the Prime Minister of the country. While the government has certainly succeeded in bringing down inflation, tackling corruption its failure to generate enough jobs has invited criticism from all quarters. While electorally, BJP had its best performance in Jammu and Kashmir, the sharp slide in the internal security condition of the state has put several question marks over its inability to come up with a new strategy to deal with the impending crisis.\n\nWhile time and again, PM Modi has reiterated his mantra of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas', the highhandedness of Gau Rakshaks and other fringe groups have undermined the government's desire to take along all sections of the society. \n\nThe realm of foreign policy has been really tricky for this government. With a changing geo-political scenario the government has been grappling with new ways and strategies - especially when it comes to Pakistan and China. While India's relation with Bangladesh and Nepal has improved a series of flip flops with Pakistan and China's belligerence stance and disregard for India's security concerns have hemmed in the Modi government into a corner.

Narendra Modi had promised us that he will transform India, end corruption, bring in industry, generate jobs, end social strife and forge a new path with neighbours and word powers. With his emphatic victory in the polls people were buoyed with the hope of a transformation that would herald a new era and catapult India towards a path of development. \n\nThree years have passed since Narendra Modi was anointed as the Prime Minister of the country. While the government has certainly succeeded in bringing down inflation, tackling corruption its failure to generate enough jobs has invited criticism from all quarters. While electorally, BJP had its best performance in Jammu and Kashmir, the sharp slide in the internal security condition of the state has put several question marks over its inability to come up with a new strategy to deal with the impending crisis.\n\nWhile time and again, PM Modi has reiterated his mantra of 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas', the highhandedness of Gau Rakshaks and other fringe groups have undermined the government's desire to take along all sections of the society. \n\nThe realm of foreign policy has been really tricky for this government. With a changing geo-political scenario the government has been grappling with new ways and strategies - especially when it comes to Pakistan and China. While India's relation with Bangladesh and Nepal has improved a series of flip flops with Pakistan and China's belligerence stance and disregard for India's security concerns have hemmed in the Modi government into a corner.

While there are a considerable number of cases where the Judiciary's intervention has been sought and lauded there are some cases where its intervention has been questioned - most notably the day-to-day running of BCCI. Critics argue that when the Courts are clogged with thousands of cases it is a futile exercise on the part of the Judiciary to spent time administering the functions of our apex cricket body. However, activists are in favour of the Court's intervention vis-a-vis subversion of fundamental rights - like access to food, healthcare, issues farm distress. Therefore we ask are the Judicial interventions due to under reach & failure on the part of the executive? Are we seeing a more pro-active role on the part of the Judiciary?\n\nWatch full show: http://www.ndtv.com/video/news/the-big-fight/courts-judicial-overreach-vs-activism-454651?yt\n\nNDTV is one of the leaders in the production and broadcasting of un-biased and comprehensive news and entertainment programmes in India and abroad.

Small yet meaningful measures such as vacuuming of roads, sprinkling of water was not done. The situation worsened further by smoke rising from crop burning in neighbouring states such as Punjab and Haryana, and cracker bursting during the festival of Diwali. Now, most of northern India sits with a cloud of deadly smog hovering over it, the air quality index hit 'severe' for several cities in the region. Experts on the show, Chandra Bhushan from Centre for Science and Environment and Dr. Guleria, a renowned Pulmonologist claimed that this air pollution could lead to thousands of deaths as the air puts at risk children as well as adults.
