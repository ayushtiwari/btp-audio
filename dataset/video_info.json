The expenditure on this mela was wrong. \n\nI have not spoken against Kumbh Mela. It was just a context. Also, my views are personal, not of the Congress party says Congress leader Udit Raj. This anti-Hindu trade is in Congress\u2019 DNA. Senior Congress leaders have often made anti-Hindu comments. If we are secular states, then Madrassas education should not be state-funded says Amit Malviya. \n\nI realized that it may create controversy.

Revolts were held for re-opening temples. However, the Maha Vikas Aghadi hardened the stance despite the protest by Hindu priests. Pluck cards stating \u2018Public can have madira in bars, but devotees barred from mandirs\u2019 were also raised.\n\nMaharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari lashed out at Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray questioning his belief of Hindutva. In response to this, CM Thackeray took a dig at Guv jibing his meet with Actor Kangana Ranaut.\n\nWhy are the Aghadis blocking people\u2019s faith?\n\nLawyer Shehzad says, \u2018\u2018From Mandir wahin banayenge, to mandir nahi khulwayenge\u2019. Imagine what Balasaheb Thackeray must be feeling that in his state \u2018madira peena\u2019 is allowed but not preaching in temples\u2019, and Spiritual Guru Acharya Vikrmaditya says, \u2018There are over 4 lakh bars and restaurants in Maharashtra, how many people would be going there every day? Can we not make guidelines for temples?\u2019.\n\nWhereas Political Analyst Sumanth Raman says, \u2018No need to gather in large numbers to preach your faith. You can always pray at home, this was said by Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, now his party is calling out for the opening of temples\u2019.\n\nWATCH!\n\n#MandirMahaBharat #AghadiBlocksMandir #UddhavThackeray\n\nSubscribe to Times Now | Click Here \u25ba http://goo.gl/U9ibPb\n\nLog on to www.timesnownews.com ( https://www.timesnownews.com/videos) for the latest news & updates.

It acts as a consensus that emerges from the knowledge of experts.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Berlin War and the beginning of the Cold War, India placed its faith in multilateralism. India realized the whole idea of 'friends with all, but allies with no one' policy might have left it vulnerable in the face of Chinese adventurism. \n\nIndia now has a cause to correct and look for options to contain China in the subcontinent.

Waging a war against China is not easy, but creating an alliance with the United States is still in talks. India has exposed the limitations pertaining to foreign policy. It acts as a consensus that emerges from the knowledge of experts.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Berlin War and the beginning of the Cold War, India placed its faith in multilateralism.
