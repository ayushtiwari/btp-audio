Rahul Gandhi has been protesting since the last few days, perched on the top of a tractor, fighting for the cause of farmers. Rahul Gandhi however, was seen seated on a sofa seat as claimed by the BJP on the tractor, during one of these protests. An image was made viral by the BJP in which Rahul Gandhi can be seen seated on a sofa seat, which several of BJP ministers tweeted. Rahul Gandhi took a jibe at the Prime Minister when one of the NDA ministers questioned him about the tractor image. Rahul Gandhi questioned why nothing was said when two special aircraft were delivered for the Prime Minister. \n\nRahul Gandhi\u2019s reference to the aeroplanes is in regard to the Air India One, which has been procured for the VVIPs. To discuss the same, Navika Kumar is joined by Shehzad Poonawalla, Sanjay Jha, Abbas Hafeez, Gaurav Bhatia. \n\nShehzad Poonawalla states that Rahul Gandhi is always confused about the facts, whether it\u2019s Rafale plane or this plane. Gaurav Bhatia adds to this and states that a person who has been doing his picnics on INS Viraat definitely doesn\u2019t have the right to raise these questions. Sanjay Jha, the former Congress member, refutes these arguments and states that if Rahul Gandhi decides to get into a tractor and really make that a symbolic manifestation of farmer protest being backed by the Congress party, it should be considered good in a democracy. \n\nSubscribe to Times Now | Click Here \u25ba http://goo.gl/U9ibPb\n\nLog on to www.timesnownews.com ( https://www.timesnownews.com/videos) for the latest news & updates.

Rahul Gandhi has been protesting since the last few days, perched on the top of a tractor, fighting for the cause of farmers. Rahul Gandhi however, was seen seated on a sofa seat as claimed by the BJP on the tractor, during one of these protests. An image was made viral by the BJP in which Rahul Gandhi can be seen seated on a sofa seat, which several of BJP ministers tweeted. Rahul Gandhi took a jibe at the Prime Minister when one of the NDA ministers questioned him about the tractor image. Rahul Gandhi questioned why nothing was said when two special aircraft were delivered for the Prime Minister. \n\nRahul Gandhi\u2019s reference to the aeroplanes is in regard to the Air India One, which has been procured for the VVIPs. To discuss the same, Navika Kumar is joined by Shehzad Poonawalla, Sanjay Jha, Abbas Hafeez, Gaurav Bhatia. \n\nShehzad Poonawalla states that Rahul Gandhi is always confused about the facts, whether it\u2019s Rafale plane or this plane. Gaurav Bhatia adds to this and states that a person who has been doing his picnics on INS Viraat definitely doesn\u2019t have the right to raise these questions. Sanjay Jha, the former Congress member, refutes these arguments and states that if Rahul Gandhi decides to get into a tractor and really make that a symbolic manifestation of farmer protest being backed by the Congress party, it should be considered good in a democracy. \n\nSubscribe to Times Now | Click Here \u25ba http://goo.gl/U9ibPb\n\nLog on to www.timesnownews.com ( https://www.timesnownews.com/videos) for the latest news & updates.
