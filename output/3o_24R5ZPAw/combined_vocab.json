china and the united states rules to me and i won't don't want no these are some questions we'll explore without him and yet supple and this conversation out and let me begin fires we tell us about four miles foreign secretary with us about this in an important points in our relationship with china any amount of stressing this would be an understatement it can also be a cliche but then so as the next question how do we deal with china and can we you think caught on fire and wanna see that in nato's hope who it it's influence not just in an immediate vicinity would also on our borders resisted okay started we open this out to be nice of you was coming in now from our colors of the former foreign seconded bingo stared across to jong schools offer no all the incentives to security program at the c. s. i s. thank you for joining us on his custody disasters in off the back didn't get destined to be on the one in this mathematician back to wits against china need to work in collaboration with others can we trust the others why these are not as much you can dish it got member of parliament from their ideas about what good is possible partners be mr robertson on a konzi's are sworn to

okay did neighboring is sitting there good gardening she is a intractable is that it is a vision is expansionist india needs to be careful ropes seek our goal was awful also have bought problem so to speak with china's rise and that's really the way that we should take this for that's a cop or a view is that it expressed yacht was a book on your response to that you get you don't read my pieces in the times of india and the whitewater in and it'd one these when really do okay so the relay and andrew neil before we go back into the conversation we started out great hundred zero body to nurse an independent china study just joining us from hong kong aka what are still getting gauging china the tour de escalation so the little guy may believe said look we need to continue down this bottoming gauge wouldn't forget about to be doing too much buy into a relationship strategic when a decade what have you with united states and others get their own interest in their own axe to grind so he didn't china focus on that anybody ever results you didn't answer being optimistic are you certain zoe what you said drizzling that china is interested in pieces and mortars suggesting you give us a copper not putting off up the pot you know a problem option is that china is about exercising in the south china sea of what you're trying to remind him of eating well in my view we are trying to legitimize expansionism your broker want constructive engagement without moving back to restore the status quo ante will soon be out you're talking about what ines no rules based diplomacy when you don't follow the rules i'm not understanding it should we be antonio should we be playing by china's rules and as long as we know that there are okay what happened when you in that won't but that relax out of has so many meetings of italy and i don't like it on the gately during the prime minister in the president's we've had outgrown the human dna a sense if you decide to was the indian that

good let's go go up by joins course many os game not be got the others according to some that it's only the americans and id when i see try now what about the austrians the british the french the japanese the vietnamese the videos wall so when at one time doing business in that great dies with the chinese today in the army jail for the idea to disregard it's funny and large number of focus on this planet believes that india should not end up becoming a u. s. guys think that's a point ready when wait but that doesn't mean that we become being trapped in an exclusive as system and hope to becoming equal partner is also often chinese when they are not interested in that get out line and the u. problems is both called liars and lawrence to run and it's true you also read that is is almost up the awesome all fundamental question taking off from where the idea genders a good guest off why does china thing he can walk or roll arrest and state expect us to engage with it's simple as lou resisted book den and finally get a coalition of nations contain china and getting gaby annie what ought not in such a coalition of nations and how would you define these nations we want a takeoff
