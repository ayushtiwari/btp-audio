the day and the government is not adding opulence so i'm looking to end the secrecy dines not try to scratch when it goes someplace it'll be all and the layout of secrecy and eyes problem indeed the energy the men the economist was one of the key once i did bide our guide the end of the monroe and saying among us on the viability plus meeting deadlines now and i'm going to begin by asking you owe the most basic of more questions some people have estimated that on his stand on owned the states it would add one point eight one point nine west end of the above is going to visit okay so so you are saying let me if i'm wrong with god and cheap energy that nehemiah we have to be financed by at jackson is the use of taxes is that what threatening us must be nobody point in the deceive this is a massive massive admission on your part so because this is something that we want awarded the oscars stick so there's no getting around raising taxes very very significant very very significant is the

other reason than when we have the scarborough wet weather that's of course about the toaster design we vetted that that the g. battered thank you for speaking with me you know as these disclosures made it completely out midnight is no one to lie about unless the middle guys and as you to godwin topless photos saturday's by the way of taxes in fact if neal has to walk some light on subsidies will promise on foot and i suppose bomb and we looked up might have to go on when it ends that last one of the reasons why the court has been wishy washy we don't want asking you can see one

this says enlighten as been given a salad at it can presumably in the islands and is going away this is betty many significant us also that all is that god and subsidies will pull out what we scrapped and what does the advisers say he's as disproportionate subsidies i want out bought off what denies i need to win it by some in that but isn't that in any significant viewers know one of the cromwell's is not giving us the basic he gets off is put into this game because perhaps perhaps not always feel as i did it go set back so this is being that hopes when we get way out those winds will come and that is the question suicide and some hike in taxes to find night is an hour and a mining bob week when a threat id used that to gain that's the question we needed it tonight a quarter of this oakland that god is with me on and on and i can someone that we got in days i want of let's begin with on and on an item this man has a eulogy at addition to protect you watson on site what it says economist of la di da must be getting this man is not an intellectual lightweight nine that easy bodies and so that's taken at face value and not videos invited as brilliant as some one of the

i see you will limit the advice that was given to women is domenici to come up with them all guns elegance to go most importantly when is he going to raise this money fromm is it going to be by imposing texan and that guy's and taking away subsidies from promise what does that say allison did obviously the finest esteemed that's all he's getting into the pigeon peas and to look at it and i get isn't really as that goes on the fist to have also been released and it has crossed one thirty four percent of the budget estimate you know it did not today not moscow question even gonna rise and it would definitely missed the mark that is at present what is starting lineups bought by the member nations bob mays the ben n g one of the economy is that has been cited by rolla when he was giving

ideas don't ask it would've gone from the taxpayer's pocket in the middle class taxpayers bob did it because of proceeding we are louisa may have been lines went to india as in by now the middle gaza's would be played in a significant problems and they would be continuity one one opposite of the of income taxes is something i've been saying worldwide that this is a bad idea and they should be doing so not yet it is then represented a lot like kind of brings us to the little guys didn't one reason for the difference is up every oh i did not talk to the middle classes in need of money in his

middle-class be put on so so yeah but you know i'm in acting he does what we pay our taxes on the hot sun sometimes to see objects as being wasted on crossing and schemes that are not what i needed my you've said that ostensibly this deal would give money to the plot but even that is appointed to be done many economists the zionism is that it was that made in fact even in it's got it but wasn't it needs more lax and that's what will be good enough different definition that the you'll be at fault that are probably the baseline know what to others and on that that i did a good lead and at that but what i wasn't found not guilty as the obvious the hot great results levi dollar value today what is it out on the today trying to scam was bought by nor giving us all the information so that you
